### Resources

This is a handy kit of resources and lists that I would like to accept PRs for. It will be updated ad hoc when I see fit and is of dubious maintainability. If you'd like to contribute, I thank you!

If you're worried about submitting your first PR or don't know how to, ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/samantha_gold).
